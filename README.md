Jobeet Tutorial with Symfony2
=============================

Jobeet is a great tutorial wrote by the Symfony team to help you learn how to use the framework by building a fully functional job board website. It was wrote for Symfony 1.x version and now itâ€™s time for a remake using the new Symfony2 framework.

In the following weeks I will begin to post the parts of making the Jobeet website using Symfony2, so it will help beginners to learn and understand how the framework works. I will try to follow the original Jobeet tutorial, but I will also make some changes from time to time to reflect my personal developing style.

1) Installing the Standard Edition
----------------------------------

When it comes to installing the Symfony Standard Edition, you have the
following options.

### Use Composer (*recommended*)

As Symfony uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Symfony application:

    php composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition path/to/install

Composer will install Symfony and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.

### Download an Archive File

To quickly test Symfony, you can also download an [archive][3] of the Standard
Edition and unpack it somewhere under your web server root directory.

If you downloaded an archive "without vendors", you also need to install all
the necessary dependencies. Download composer (see above) and run the
following command:

    php composer.phar install

2) Checking your System Configuration
-------------------------------------

Before starting coding, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for Symfony.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php

Access the `config.php` script from a browser:

    http://localhost/path/to/symfony/app/web/config.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.
